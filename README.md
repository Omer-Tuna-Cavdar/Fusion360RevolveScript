# Fusion360RevolveScript

# How to Use and Mathematical Explanation of the Fusion 360 Revolve Script

## Overview

This script allows you to:

1. **Input a Mathematical Function**: Define a function \( y = f(x) \) in terms of \( x \).
2. **Define an Interval**: Specify the interval \([x_{\text{start}}, x_{\text{end}}]\) over which the function will be plotted.
3. **Select an Axis of Revolution**: Choose to revolve the function around the **x**, **y**, or **z** axis, with an optional offset.
4. **Generate a 3D Solid**: Create a 3D solid by revolving the area under the curve around the chosen axis.

This script is designed for use within Autodesk Fusion 360's scripting environment. After running the script, you will be guided through a series of input prompts. Once you provide the necessary details, the script creates a sketch of the function and then performs a 360° revolve operation, producing a solid body that represents the volume of revolution.

### 4. Inspect Your Solid

After the script completes, the resulting 3D body will appear in your Fusion 360 workspace. You can rotate, pan, and zoom to inspect the geometry created by the revolve operation.

## Mathematical Explanation

### The Function and the Interval

You provide a function \( f(x) \) defined as \( y = f(x) \). The domain of interest is the interval \([x_{\text{start}}, x_{\text{end}}]\). For each \( x \) in that interval, the script calculates \( y = f(x) \), generating a set of points \((x, f(x))\) that are plotted in the Cartesian plane.

### Revolving the Curve

A **volume of revolution** is created when a planar curve is rotated around an axis. If the axis of revolution is one of the principal axes (**x**, **y**, or **z**) in 3D space, the resulting solid is symmetrical around that axis.

- **Revolve Around the X-Axis**:  
  Revolving \( y = f(x) \) around the x-axis results in each point \((x, f(x))\) tracing a circular path perpendicular to the x-axis. The radius of this circular path is \(|f(x)|\).

- **Revolve Around the Y-Axis**:  
  Revolving around the y-axis treats \( x \) as a radial dimension. The curve \((x, f(x))\) is interpreted in a way that, when revolved, forms a symmetric solid around the y-axis.

- **Revolve Around the Z-Axis**:  
  Revolving around the z-axis involves plotting the function in the XZ plane (swapping the y-coordinate to z) and rotating it around the z-axis, creating a solid symmetric about the z-axis.

### Offsetting the Axis

The **offset** moves the axis of revolution away from its origin-centered position. For example, revolving around the x-axis with an offset of \( d \) shifts the axis to \( y = d \) in the xy-plane. This changes the shape of the resulting solid, often creating a "donut-like" shape if the curve does not intersect the new axis line.

### The Integral Definition

In calculus, the volume \( V \) of a solid of revolution generated by revolving \( y = f(x) \) around the x-axis from \( x = a \) to \( x = b \) is given by the integral:

\[
V = \pi \int_{a}^{b} [f(x)]^2 \, dx
\]

This integral represents the sum of infinitesimally thin cylindrical slices (disks) along the x-axis, each with a radius \( f(x) \) and thickness \( dx \). The script conceptually performs a similar operation by creating a 3D model through the revolve feature, which visually represents the accumulation of these infinitesimal volumes.

### Relating the Script to the Integral

While the script does not compute the integral analytically, it leverages the geometric principle underlying the integral definition:

1. **Plotting the Function**:  
   The script evaluates \( f(x) \) at numerous points within the specified interval, generating a smooth curve.

2. **Creating the Profile**:  
   It connects the curve to the chosen axis, forming a closed profile that represents the area to be revolved.

3. **Performing the Revolve Operation**:  
   Fusion 360's revolve feature then generates the 3D solid by rotating this profile 360°, effectively summing up all the infinitesimal volumes represented by each rotational slice.

### The Integral as the Theoretical Backbone

The integral is fundamentally about taking a limit of sums. For volumes of revolution, this means summing infinitely many infinitesimal cylindrical slices. While the code directly constructs the solid in a CAD environment, the integral provides the precise mathematical definition and a method to compute the volume that shape represents.

**In essence**, the code's revolve command visually demonstrates the concept that the integral captures mathematically. The revolve feature creates the shape that, if you were to measure each infinitesimal slice's volume and sum them up in the limit, you would arrive at the integral formula.

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Revolve Around the X-Axis

- **Function**: \( f(x) = x^2 \)
- **Interval**: \([-2, 2]\)
- **Axis of Revolution**: `x`
- **Axis Offset**: `0`

**Expected Outcome**:  
A paraboloid created by revolving the parabola \( y = x^2 \) around the x-axis.

### Example 2: Revolve Around the Y-Axis with Offset

- **Function**: \( f(x) = \sin(x) \)
- **Interval**: \([0, 2\pi]\)
- **Axis of Revolution**: `y`
- **Axis Offset**: `1`

**Expected Outcome**:  
A wave-shaped solid generated by revolving \( y = \sin(x) \) around the y-axis, offset by 1 unit along the x-direction.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Syntax Errors in Function Input**:
  - Ensure correct use of operators:
    - Use `*` for multiplication (e.g., `2 * x`).
    - Use `**` for exponentiation (e.g., `x**2`).
  - Prefix mathematical functions with `math.` (e.g., `math.sin(x)`).
  - Ensure all parentheses are properly closed.

- **Invalid Axis Selection**:
  - Enter only `x`, `y`, or `z` when prompted for the axis of revolution.
  - Ensure the offset is a valid numerical value.

- **Function Evaluation Errors**:
  - Avoid division by zero or taking square roots/logarithms of negative numbers within the interval.
  - Confirm that the function is defined and continuous over the entire interval.

- **Profile Not Closed**:
  - Ensure that the function curve and the closing lines form a completely enclosed area.
  - Check for any gaps or overlaps in the sketch entities.

## Additional Notes

- **Units**:  
  Fusion 360 uses centimeters by default. Ensure that your function and offset values are consistent with the units used in your design.

- **Security Consideration**:  
  The script uses Python's `eval()` function to interpret the mathematical expression. Only input trusted expressions to avoid executing unintended code.

- **Customization**:  
  You can modify the script to include more complex UI elements or additional features, such as different types of revolutions or integrating multiple functions.

## Conclusion
